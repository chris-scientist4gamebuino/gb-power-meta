## Game description

Current version : Beta 1.0.0

It is a pocket version, we can also say digital, of the `Connect 4` game.

In this version no training is possible against your (Gamebuino) META.
Here the game is designed to be played by two people on the same META.

Have fun, and may the best one win!

## Why is this a beta ?

Don't worry, the game is completely playable.

I put it in beta because I would have liked to add some features, like a light game with LEDs for example, when the game is launched.
